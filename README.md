# Enhanced-Bioinspired-Backstepping-Control-for-a-Mobile-Robot-With-Unscented-Kalman-Filter

## ENPM667 Fall 2023 Project 1
A Report on Enhanced Bioinspired Backstepping Control for a Mobile Robot With Unscented Kalman Filter, a paper by ZHE XU , (Student Member, IEEE), SIMON X. YANG , (Senior Member, IEEE), AND S. ANDREW GADSDEN , (Senior Member, IEEE).


The .ipynb file consists of blocks of code that can be run in sequence to produce the simulation results. The code consists of explanations. The code was done on Google Colab but can be run on IDEs such as Visual Studio Code.

Packages needed to be installed:

1. filterpy
2. matplotlib
3. statistics
4.Â scipy

You might need to run the code a couple of times to get the right output, because of uncertainities involved in UKF and KF implementation.
